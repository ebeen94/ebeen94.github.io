							<h1>Examining the impact of chatbot avatars on users' perceived intimacy towards the chatbots.
								</h1>
							<span class="image main"></span>

							<p> 
							<h2>GOAL</h2>
							Today, chatbots are widely used, providing self-generated answers to a broad range of unexpected queries. 
							Some are even designed to be used as mental health therapists. Chatbots including Wysa, Joyable, Talkspace, Woebot provide cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to patients through daily check ins and thought restructuring chats. 
							To this trend, we wanted to understand the factors that can influence a person to feel more intimate towards a chatbot. 
							This is an important issue to address because intimacy can largely influence satisfaction in using the chatbot. 
							Hence, we conducted an experiment to discover the design of chatbot avatars on perceived intimacy towards the chatbots.<br />
							<br />
							<ul>
								<i><li>RQ: Does the design of the chatbot’s avatar affect user's perceived intimacy toward the chatbot?</i> </li>
								H1-a: Anthropomorphism of chatbot avatar (ACA) and user's gender affect perceived closeness toward the chatbot.<br />
								H1-b: ACA and user's gender affect self-disclosure towards the chatbot. <br />

								H2-a: Gender-stereotyping of chatbot avatar (GSCA) and user's gender affect perceived closeness toward the chatbot.<br />
								H2-b: GSCA and user's gender affect self-disclosure toward the chatbot.<br />

							</ul>
							</p>
							<br />
							<h2>PROCEDURE OVERVIEW</h2>
							<p>
								After obtaining approval from the institutional review board (IRB), we recruited 136 participants from private universities in South Korea. 
								Considering the nature of the questionnaires, we recruited participants aged 20 to 35 years. 
								The major age group was 20–25(46.8%), followed by 26–30(33.1%)  and 31–35(18.0%).
								<br /><br />
								The participants first received a Google form link to answer questions to the control variables. 
								Then, they randomly received a KakaoTalk (free messaging and video calling application) chat link to one of the three types of chatbots(machine-like, male-looking, female-looking). 								<br /><br />
								Upon completion of the survey, participants were instructed to submit their cover letters for an evaluation. 
								Within 24 hours, participants received an email containing an evaluation paper containing an evaluation score on 6 criteria and a brief feedback on their cover-letters. 
								Same score and feedback was given out to all the participants. 
								The email also included a link to the 2nd survey, which measured the dependent variables (perceived fairness, credibility, and usefulness of the AI reviewer.) 
								4,500KRW was awarded to each participant upon completion of the experiment.
								<br /><br />
								The chatbot started with the ice-breaking questions, followed by questions regarding individual differences (privacy concern, chatbot experience), followed by questions on perceived closeness toward the chatbot, followed by questions on self-disclosure. 
								Each participant, who completed all questions, received 5 dollars, 4,500 KRW as compensation for participation. 
								<br /><br />
								

							<h2>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</h2>
							The experiment was conducted in a 2 X 3 factorial design.<br />
							<img src="images/2by3.png" style="width:900px;height:200px;"/>
							<br /><br />
							</p>

							<b>Independent Variables</b>
							<br />
							<ul>
								<i><li> ACA (Anthropomorphism of Chatbot Avatar)</li></i>
								We categorized three designs of avatars (male, female, and machine) into the following two groups: <br />
								(1) High ACA (male and female)<br />
								(2) low ACA (machine). <br />
								<br />
								<i><li>GSCA (Gender Stereotyping of Chatbot Avatar)</li></i>
								(1) male avatar<br />
								(2) female avatar <br />
								<br />
								<i><li>User Gender</li></i>
								(1) male participants<br />
								(2) female participants <br />
								<br />
								<img src="images/chatbot_design.png" style="width:700px;height:300px;"/>
							</ul>
							<b>Dependent Variables</b><br />
							
							To measure the level of intimacy, we used perceived closeness and self-disclosure.<br />
							<br />
								<i><li>Closeness</li></i>
						
							Closeness was measured to assess user’s perceived intimacy toward the chatbot.
							The measurement items were adapted from the findings reported by Berschied (Berscheid et al., 1989). 
							All items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree). 
							The items have been internally validated (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.892) and they are organized as follows:<br /><br />
							(1) “I feel a sense of closeness now  using chatbot, Sam”<br />
							(2) “I feel friendly now using chatbot, Sam”<br />
						    (3) “I feel emotionally close now using chatbot, Sam”<br />
						    (4) “I feel familiar now using chatbot, Sam”<br />
							<br />
							
								<i><li>Self Disclosure</li></i>
							
							Self-disclosure was measured by the response frequency to the 68 questions in 10 topics (Mashek and Aron, 2004; Prager, 1997). 
							The questions comprised 10 different topics (Vondracek and Marshall, 1971), consisting of hobbies, social problems, family, health, religion, politics, relation- 155 ships, money & property, and sex-dating. 
							Each topic consisted of six or seven items, and the questions were asked in the order of being less sensitive to highly sensitive topics. 
							The sensitivity of the topics was measured through a pilot test, which measured the participants’ average response rates to each question. 
							The items on each topic were derived from previous studies on self-disclosure, and modified to be suitable with the topics of the current study through three preceding pilot tests 
							(Jourard, 1959; Jourard and Lasakow, 1958; Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright, 2003; Mitchell et al., 2003; Hyman and Handal, 2006; Kerr and Stattin, 2000; Tourangeau et al., 2010; Pioli, 1984).
							The response options were presented as follows:	Response type of 2,3,4 were counted as not responding.<br />
							<br />
							(1) “Answering the question ”<br />
							(2) “I don’t want to answer ”<br />
							(3) “I don’t know ”<br />
							(4) “I’m not interested ”<br />
							<br />
							<b>Control Variables</b><br />
							
								<i><li>Demographics</li></i>
							
							The age and education level of the participants were measured using items that were adapted from prior research (Kim, 2020). 
							<br />
							
							<br />
								<i><li>Privacy Concern</li></i>
							
							Privacy concern. We adapted four items from the findings of Sundar (Sun- dar and Kim, 2019) to measure perceived privacy concerns. 
							The reliability of the items were validated with a Cronbach’s alpha = 0.825. 
							All questionnaire items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 7 = Strongly agree).
							The questions are presented as follows : <br /><br />
							(1) “I am worried that postings written on the internet will be abused”<br />
							(2) “They worry about the possibility of theft when they write personal information to sign up for their homepage” <br />
							(3) “I’m worried because I don’t know how others will write what I posted on the Internet” <br />
							(4) “I am worried about writing or commenting on the internet because I can be used in unexpected ways”<br />
							
							
							<br />
								<i><li>Chatbot Experience</li></i>
							
							We measured the participants’ prior experiences with chatbots. 
							Participants could choose one of the following items: <br /><br />
							(1) “I don’t know what chatbot is”<br />
							(2) “I know what chatbot is but haven’t used it”<br />
							(3) “I have used chatbot less than five times”<br />
							(4) “I have used a chatbot more than five times ”. <br />
							</p>
							
							<b>Manipulation check </b><br />
							Seven participants were recruited to test the manipulation of ACA (low versus high) before the survey. 
							Three images of the avatars were presented, accompanied by questions:(1) “It looks human”;(2) “It looks friendly”
							;(3) “It feels conscious”.
							The items were adopted and modified from (ji Hong, 2016; Song, 2019) and were measured with a 7- point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 7 = Strongly agree). 
							Based on the responses, we conducted an independent t-test. 
							The results of the t-test were statistically significant (p < 0.001, t(19) = 5.914. Human-like avatars had a higher mean(M = 5.333, SD = 1.029) than that of the machine-like avatar(M = 2.381, SD = 1.177).  
							The internal reliability of the responses was validated with a Cronbach’s alpha = 0.872.
                            <br /> <br /><br /><br />
							<h2>RESULTS</h2>
							<ul>
								<i><li>
									H1-a: The anthropomorphism of chatbot avatar (ACA) and user gender affect his/her perceived closeness toward the chatbot.
								</li></i>
							-> Male participants showed higher level of perceived closeness toward the chatbots.<br />
							-> Male participants who were assigned machine chatbots showed higher level of anthropomorphism toward the chatbots.<br />
							<br />
							<i><u>Main effect</u></i><br />
							user gender — perceived closeness (O)<br />
							ACA         — perceived closeness (X)<br />
							<br />
							<i><u>Interaction effect</u></i><br />
							User gender — ACA (partially significant p < 0.1) <br />
						    </ul>

							
							<br />	

							<ul>
								<i><li>
									H1-b: The ACA and user gender affect his/her self-disclosure level of the chatbot. 
								</li></i>
							-> There was no significant effect of ACA or user gender on user's self-disclosure toward the chatbots.<br />
							<br />
							<i><u>Main effect</u></i><br />
							user gender — self disclosure (X)<br />
							ACA         — self disclosure (X)<br />
							<br />
							<i><u>Interaction effect</u></i><br />
							User gender — ACA (X) <br />
						    </ul>
							<br />


							<ul>
								
									<i><li>H2-a: Gender- stereotyping of chatbot avatar (GSCA) and user gender affect his/her perceived closeness toward the chatbot.</li></i>
									<i><li>H2-b: GSCA and user gender affect the self-disclosure level toward the chatbot.</li> </i> 
							-> There was no significant effect of ACA or user gender on user's self-disclosure toward the chatbots.<br />
							<br />
							<i><u>Main effect</u></i><br />
							GSCA        — perceived closeness/ self-disclosure (X)<br />
							user gender — perceived closeness/ self-disclosure (X)<br />
							<br />
							<i><u>Interaction effect</u></i><br />
							GSCA        — user gender (X) <br />
						    </ul>
							<br />
							<h2>Further Analysis</h2>
							We examined the response quality by examining the length of each response and frequency of negative expressions. 
							Then, we conducted a MANOVA to examine whether the design of the chatbot avatar and user gender have notable effects on the response quality. 
							<br />
							The frequency of negative expressions was measured by the average use of negative expressions in the participants’ responses to the chatbot questions. 
							After data preprocessing using the Natural language Toolkit (NLTK), the average frequency of eighteen negative expressions (e.g. ‘opposite’, ‘incorrect’, ‘negative’, ‘not particularly’, ‘not much’) was analyzed. <br /><br />
							-> There was no significant effect of user's gender on user's quality of responses toward the chatbots.<br />
							-> There was a significant effect of ACA on user's length of responses toward the chatbots.<br />
							<br /><br />
							<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
							We explored the effects of chatbot avatars and user gender on users’ perceived intimacy toward the chatbot and found three insights.
							<br /><br />
							First, there was a significant effect of user gender on their closeness to the chatbot. 
							Male participants displayed higher closeness than female participants. 
							The results were especially significant for avatars with low anthropomorphism (machine-like). 
							One of the potential reasons can be ascribed to the natural disposition of males. 
							They tend to show more positive attitude toward computers than females (Whitley Jr, 1997).
							<br /><br />
							Second, participants showed higher response rates to questions asked by machine-like chatbots than to human-like chatbots. 
							From this, we can infer that the machine-like characteristics of the avatars elicited a low level of social presence (Go and Sundar, 2019), which allowed users to feel more comfortable about revealing their personal information.
							<br /><br />
							Third, there was no significant effect of GSCA on users’ perceived intimacy toward the chatbot. 
							This may be due to the use of text-based chatbots in the experiment, which reduced the effect of gender stereotype. 
							Unlike voice, the static profile pictures did not remind the users of the chatbot’s gender, thus resulting in a low degree of gender stereotype.
